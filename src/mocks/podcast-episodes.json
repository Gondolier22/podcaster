			"description": "Beginning in the nineties, pop songwriters have traveled to a 13th-century castle in the south of France for what’s come to be known as a “song camp” – a place where songwriters and collaborators can hunker down and spend a week together writing the next big hits.\n\nThe castle’s owner Miles Copeland, former manager of The Police, brought songwriters to this far-flung location for a dose of creativity, and yielded massive success through the process: artists like Celine Dion, Britney Spears and Miranda Lambert have all benefited from songs stemming from these retreats.\n\nOver the last fifteen years, song camps have exploded in popularity from Peter Coquillard’s Bali Invitational, to Rihanna’s $200k LA camp, to the Anti Social Camp: a NYC-based event and the world’s largest songwriting retreat. This episode of Switched On Pop, we take a look at the secret world of song camps, and even manage to be a fly-on-the-wall in a camp with songwriter Nicholas Petricca of Walk The Moon, Julia Cumming of Sunflower Bean, engineer Will Campbell and producer Andrew Maury. \nLearn more about your ad choices.

			"description": "Recently while scrolling twitter we saw a clip from American Idol of judge Katy Perry admonishing an auditioner on the show to “Enunciate!”\n\nThe video went viral because of Perry’s incensed reaction, but also because the contestant’s performance of Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” offered a crystalline example of a popular style of singing that has produced reactions of love and—like for Perry—hate. \n\nIt’s a style that features elongated vowels, clipped consonants, and runaway phrasing associated with contemporary singers like Halsey, Jorja Smith, and Shawn Mendes, and like many things in the 21st century it got its name from a tweet—specifically by the user @trackdroppa who boasted in 2009, “Voice so smooth it’s like i’m singing in cursive”\n\nIn this episode we speak to vocal coaches and journalists to to ask: Where did this cursive style come from? What are the vocal techniques used to create this sound? And why does cursive singing create so much backlash?\n\nSongs Discussed\n\n\nShawn Mendes - Stitches\n\nZooey Deschanel, M. Ward - Winnie the Pooh\n\nMick Jagger - Strange Game\n\nSelena Gomez, A$AP Rocky - Good For You\n\nFrank Zappa, Moon Zappa - Valley Girl\n\nMark Ronson, Amy Winehouse - Valerie\n\nbenny blanco, Halsey, Khalid\t- Eastside \n\nJorja Smith - Teenage Fantasy\n\nTones And I - Dance Monkey\n\nSia - Cheap Thrills\n\nCorinne Bailey Rae - Put Your Records On\n\nBlink-182 - All The Small Things\n\nSZA - Kill Bill\n\n\nMore\n\nAshaala Shanae\nhttps://www.themahi.com/founder\n\nJumi Akinfenwa\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/contributor/jumi-akinfenwa\nLearn more about your ad choices.

			"description": "In 1964, Louis Armstrong knocked the Beatles off the top of the charts with his recording of “Hello, Dolly!” becoming, at age 62, the oldest artist to ever hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

			"description": "Taylor Swift is currently the most streamed artist in the world as she’s commandeered the media as she embarks on her Eras tour around the globe. It's likely to be the highest grossing tour of all time, crossing $1B in sales. What’s more, she’s just released her 6th studio album since 2020, and her 3rd re-recording of her older material called Taylor’s Versions. She famously got in a spat with the new owner of her master recordings. She decided to take back control with her own hands and voice, creating mostly true-to-the-original updates alongside a smorgasbord of bonus material.\n\nFirst there was Fearless from 2008, then Red from 2012 and now Speak Now the last of her more country leaning albums having originally arrived in 2010. Switched On Pop listens to Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) for whats is and isn’t working musically, how the re-recordings are fairing, and where this ambitious project may go next.\n\nJoining the conversation is Lauren Michele Jackson American cultural critic, assistant professor of English and African American studies at Northwestern, author of White Negroes: When Cornrows Were in Vogue ... and Other Thoughts on Cultural Appropriation and a contributing writer to the New Yorker in her review of Taylor Swift’s midnights said “I’ve always maintained that Swift is incapable of writing a bad song.”\n\nMORE\nPop Pantheon: Checking in on Taylor Swift's Re-Recordings So Far (with Charlie Harding, Larisha Paul & Nora Princiotti)\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\nTaylor Swift - Fearless, Red, Speak Now, Never Grow Up, The Story Of Us, Sparks Fly, Mine, Mean, Superman, Karma, Better than Revenge, Electric Touch, Castles Crumbling, When Emma Falls in Love, I Can See You, Back, To December, Last Kiss\nDef Leppard - Pour Some Sugar On Me\nGloria Gaynor - I Will Survive \nLearn more about your ad choices.

If you've openly wondered why concert tickets seemingly have gotten more confusing and expensive, this episode's for you.\n\n–\n\nContent creator and head of the Beyhive Kalen Allen is more than OK spending four thousand dollars on one ticket for Beyoncé’s Renaissance tour. 2023 feels like a big year for huge stadium tours for artists like Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, Ed Sheeran and more. But why are tickets so expensive, and how much are fans willing to put up with in order to go? Sam talks with music journalist Nate Rogers about why the touring industry might just be broken and what lawmakers and some artists are trying to do to fix it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

			"description": "Vulture might have killed the song of the summer back in 2016, but if you’re a member of the LGBTQ+ community, it’s hard to argue against “Padam Padam” by Kylie Minogue. The track, released this May, has taken the queer community by storm, quickly becoming ubiquitous and inescapable – it's hard to even scroll on Twitter without a well-timed meme about the \"padam-ic\" popping up on the timeline. However, Minogue's song hasn't even cracked the Billboard Hot 100; instead, its status has morphed into that of a \"gay anthem,\" a song widely celebrated inside the community but unable to garner longstanding success outside of it.\n\nThis episode of Switched on Pop, producer Reanna Cruz tackles a question that the LGBTQ+ community has debated over for decades: what makes a gay anthem? Through talking with everyone from academics to their close friends, the answer takes us from Judy Garland to 1920s cabaret to, of course, \"Padam Padam.\"\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nKylie Minogue – Padam Padam\n\nÉdith Piaf – Padam padam\n\nKylie Minogue – Supernova\n\nMischa Spoliansky – Das lila Lied (The Lavender Song)\n\nQueen – I Want To Break Free\n\nLady Gaga – Born This Way\n\nLondon Philharmonic Choir – Amazing Grace\n\nTraditional – God Save The King\n\nQueen – We Are The Champions\n\nTom Robinson Band – Glad to be Gay\n\nDiana Ross – I'm Coming Out\n\nJudy Garland – Alone Together (Live At Carnegie Hall/1961)\n\nCountess Luann – Chic C'est La Vie\n\nJudy Garland – The Trolley Song\n\nLady Gaga – La Vie En Rose\n\nBronski Beat – Smalltown Boy\n\nVillage People – Y.M.C.A.\n\nSylvester – You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\n\nMiquel Brown – So Many Men, So Little Time\n\nDepeche Mode – Never Let Me Down Again\n\nThe Weather Girls – It's Raining Men\n\nGloria Gaynor – I Will Survive\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

			"description": "As summer comes upon us, it’s time for some Billboard shake ups. On this week’s edition of Chartbreakers, we’re looking at the recent iterations of the Hot 100 and a trend that has slowly been creeping up in popularity over the past few months: the influx of regional Mexican music. The past two years have seen many songs by Mexican artists making their way onto Billboard, all managing to highlight different scenes and sounds from the different states in Mexico. \n\nWe’re joined this week by the cohost of the NPR Music podcast Alt. Latino, Anamaria Sayre, who says that Mexican regional, or simply, regional, is a marketing “bucket term” that encompasses different Latin genres including everything from norteño to corridos, all genres that are comfortably finding a home in the top 20 of the Hot 100 in 2023.\n\nOf course, there’s more happening outside of Latin music. Much of the chart has been stagnant since our last iteration of Chartbreakers, but, as always, there’s been some shake ups thanks to the world of the TikTok sped-up remix, the legacy artist, and on some occasions, a mix of both (we’re looking at you, Miguel).\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nEslabon Armado, Peso Pluma – Ella Baila Sola\n\nBizarrap, Peso Pluma – Peso Pluma: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 55\n\nGrupo Frontera, Bad Bunny – un x100to\n\nFuerza Regida – TQM\n\nGrupo Frontera, Fuerza Regida – Bebe Dame\n\nLos Tigres del Norte – Prisión De Amor\n\nChalino Sanchez, Banda Brava – Alma Enamorada\n\nChalino Sanchez, Los Amables Del Norte – El Crimen De Culiacán\n\nRamon Ayala y Sus Bravos del Norte – Solo Una Patada\n\nGrupo Firme, Junior H – Tronando Ligas\n\nBanda MS de Sergio Lizárraga – Que Bendición\n\nDannyLux – Mi Otra Mitad\n\nNatanael Cano – Pacas De Billetes\n\nMiguel – Sure Thing\n\nFIFTY FIFTY – Cupid\n\nLana del Rey – Say Yes to Heaven\n\nTaylor Swift, Ice Spice – Karma (ft.

			"description": "In the song \"Touch\" from Daft Punk's final studio album, 2013's Random Access Memories, featured artist Paul Williams sings a line that augured the end of an impressive collaboration: \"I need something more.\" With RAM, Daft Punk pulled out all the stops, going the opposite direction of their previous albums, to \"give life back to music\" and bestow hearts and souls upon their robotic doppelgängers.\nRAM features almost no samples or programmed digital instruments, instead leaning into extensive collaborations with legendary studio musicians, iconic producers like Nile Rodgers, and modern mavens such as Pharrell. The making of RAM followed the blueprint of classic albums from what Daft Punk called \"the golden age\" of recording—Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Pink Floyd. The duo spent over a million dollars, held five years of studio sessions, and painstakingly crafted each track. The result was a record that helped usher in a retro disco-funk revival across pop music and generated a smash hit in \"Get Lucky.\" The band had perhaps crafted their magnum opus—but did it also represent the conclusion of their epic narrative of the battle between human and machine?\nSongs Discussed\nDaft Punk - Give Life Back to Music\nDaft Punk - Lose Yourself to Dance (feat.

			"description": "Throughout their legendary career, Daft Punk continued to prove that the more robotic their music became, the more human they sounded. This dichotomy came to a head on their third album, aptly titled Human After All. Where their past two records wired their circuits and gave the robots a voice, on Human After All, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo gave Daft Punk sentience. On Human After All robots rock, but they also question their rigid programming. The record's ensuing tour and resulting live album, Alive 2007, furthered the narrative by ushering in a new age of live electronic performance. The impact of these two records range from the development of EDM to everlasting hits like “Technologic.” On episode three of our Listening 2 Daft Punk series, we take a look at these two records, and how both Alive and Human After All imbued the robots with super intelligence.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nDaft Punk - Human After All\n\nDaft Punk - The Prime Time of Your Life\n\nDaft Punk - Robot Rock\n\nBreakwater - Release the Beast\n\nDaft Punk - Steam Machine\n\nDaft Punk - The Brainwasher\n\nBlack Sabbath - Iron Man\n\nDaft Punk - Technologic\n\nDaft Punk - Emotion\n\nJohn Williams – Wild Signals\n\nDaft Punk – Touch It / Technologic\n\nDaft Punk – Oh Yeah\n\nDaft Punk – Technologic\n\nBusta Rhymes – Touch It\n\nDaft Punk – Around the World / Harder Better Faster Stronger\n\nDaft Punk – Face to Face / Short Circuit\n\nDaft Punk – Da Funk / Daftendirekt\n\nKanye West – Stronger\n\nKanye West – On Sight\n\nDaft Punk – Human After All / Together / One More Time / Music Sounds Better With You\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

On their second album Discovery, Daft Punk fully lean into the artificial – singing through robotic vocoders that correspond with their now-iconic robot helmets.\nBut in there is a paradox, explored on episode 2 of Listening to Daft Punk: the more machine the robots become, the more human the music sounds.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nDaft Punk - One More Time\n\nDaft Punk - Teachers\n\nDaft Punk - Aerodynamic\n\nSister Sledge - Il Macquillage Lady\n\nAC/DC - Thunderstruck\n\nLaurie Anderson - O Superman\n\nDaft Punk - Revolution 909\n\nKraftwerk - Autobahn\n\nKraftwerk - The Robots\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire - Let's Groove\n\nHerbie Hancock - I Thought It Was You\n\nZapp - More Bounce to the Ounce\n\nStevie Wonder - 1-2-3 Sesame Street\n\nCher - Believe\n\nKid Rock - Only God Knows Why\n\nBarry Manilow - Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed\n\nDaft Punk - Superheroes\n\nEdwin Birdsong - Cola Bottle Baby\n\nElectric Light Orchestra - Evil Woman\n\nDaft Punk - Face to Face\n\nDaft Punk - Something About Us\n\nDaft Punk - Voyager\n\nDaft Punk - Veridis Quo\n\nDaft Punk - Superheroes\n\nDaft Punk, Pharrell Williams - LYTD (Vocoder Tests) [feat.

			"description": "Ten years ago, Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories gave life back to music. The world-beating smash “Get Lucky” broke streaming records, forged a retro sound that still dominates the charts, and paved the way for artists like The Weeknd, Dua Lipa and Lizzo to craft their own throwback hits. How did Daft Punk do it? Switched On Pop’s four part-mini series Listening 2: Daft Punk unlocks the sounds, voices, and stories across all four of the group’s studio albums. On their first album, Homework, Daft Punk stretched the boundaries of electronic music and began wiring the circuits that would become their robot alter-egos, asking a fundamental question: where does the human end and the machine begin?\n\nSongs Discussed\n\n​​Daft Punk - Give Life Back to Music\n\nDaft Punk - Get Lucky (feat.

			"description": "When trouble strikes in music town, there’s one guy who gets the call. That’s me, Joe Treble, forensic musicologist. This week, I've got one of the most shocking cases I've ever worked. Someone killed the key change in pop music, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to find the perpetrator.\nThe key change used to be at large on the Billboard charts. From the 1950s to the 1990s, 20-30% of all number one hits featured one. In Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,\" the key change hits right before the final chorus. The song’s harmonic center shifts up, raising the pitch of the song, challenging the vocalist to hit higher and higher notes, juicing the big finish with excitement and pep. But starting in the 1990s the key change virtually disappeared from the Hot 100. Now, hit songs start and end in the same key, and no one seems to have even noticed. Except for me.\nThis investigation will bring me face to face with a rogue's gallery of suspects and sources: Chris Dalla Riva, music and data specialist; Brandon McFarland, alias 1-O.A.K., producer; Emily King, singer and songwriter. Each interrogation brings me closer to revealing the murderer, but will I be able to handle the terrible truth? Tune in as I tackle the hardest case of my career: the case of the missing key change!\n\nSongs Discussed\nEmily King - Georgia Sleepwalker, Medal, The Way that You Love Me\nYG, Kamaiyah, RJ, Mitch, Ty Dolla $ign - Do Yo Dance (feat. Kamaiyah, RJ, Mitch, Ty Dolla $ign)\nBeyoncé - Love On Top\nBon Jovi - Livin' On A Prayer\nWhitney Houston - I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\nFrank Sinatra - Strangers In The Night\nLearn more about your ad choices.

			"description": "We have an emergency podcast drop because the biggest and fastest moving story on the internet right now is about a song called “Heart On My Sleeve.” The track sounds like it was made by the producer Metro Boomin featuring Drake and The Weeknd. It might be one of the most consequential songs in music history because it was actually a fake, made with artificial intelligence. The blowback from this song has been enormous and a bit confusing. So host Charlie Harding went on The Vergecast podcast to break down how this song was likely made, and what it might mean for the music industry, the tech industry and all of our intellectual property. \n\n\nListen to the whole episode on The Vergecast\n\n\nRead Alex Cranz's story on Laser Bongs on The Verge\n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

			"description": "The South Korean idol group BTS is one of the biggest musical sensations in history. They're constantly breaking records and they have one of the most dedicated fan bases in the world known as Army. Their hit singles like “Boy With Love,” “Dynamite,” and “Butter” have been discussed on the show in the past for breaking through the US charts. But back in 2022, they decided to take a break from group activities and start releasing solo material because of their obligations to each fulfill mandatory military service in South Korea, precluding them from working together at the same time. Solo projects aren’t new for the group – BTS members have released mixtapes as far back as 2015 and countless solo singles – but this was the first time that BTS had ever announced a prolonged break. This moment, originally presented as a hiatus, has evolved into a whole new musical chapter for the group, with a seemingly endless array of new solo releases. Switched On Pop listens back to one track from each solo effort so far to introduce the casual listener to what is happening in this new era of BTS. Joining the show is Lenika Cruz, senior editor at The Atlantic, who literally wrote the book on BTS, simply called On BTS out on the Atlantic Editions imprint.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nj-hope, J.

			"description": "Shakira is back on the Billboard Hot 100 – thanks to the help of Argentinian producer Bizarrap. Together, their song “Shakira: BZRP Music Sessions, Vol. 53,” is layered with musical and lyrical references, from the callbacks to “She Wolf” to the multiple beat switches. It also works to play into something larger: something akin to a pop music conspiracy. On this episode of Switched On Pop, we take a closer look at Shakira’s latest, and how it’s indicative of a larger metatextual shift in pop music. \n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nShakira, Bizarrap – Shakira: BZRP Music Sessions, Vol. 53\n\nShakira – Vuelve\n\nAlanis Morrisette – Not The Doctor\n\nShakira – Whenever, Wherever\n\nShakira, Alejandro Sanz – La Tortura\n\nShakira, Wyclef Jean – Hips Don’t Lie\n\nShakira – She Wolf\n\nThe Weeknd – Blinding Lights\n\nGiorgio Moroder – Palm Springs Drive\n\nLMFAO – Party Rock Anthem\n\nPascal Letoublon – Friendships\n\nBeyoncé – Sorry\n\nTaylor Swift – All Too Well\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – Driver’s License\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
